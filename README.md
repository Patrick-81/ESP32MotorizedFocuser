# ESP32MotorizedFocuser
This project has for goal to use phone/tablet to monitor a DIY motorized focuser built around a ESP32.
For the moment the project is in pre-alpha realease. The firmware works fine for a web browser on PC. I have  serious troubles with the browsers running on an ANDROID phone.
The stepper control is not yet implemented. After solving the prvious issue this will be  integrated.
