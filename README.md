# ESP32MotorizedFocuser
This project has for goal to use phone/tablet to monitor a DIY motorized focuser built around a ESP32 and DR8825.
For the moment the project is in pre-alpha realease. Control firmaware works fine now.
Step 1: develope the firmware on ESP32						(done V0.1)
Step 2: implement the stepper control.						(done)
Step 3: design the board (easyEDA design)					(done)
step 4: Print the PCB										(ongoing)
step 5: Tests and validation.
step 6: add functions like setting multiple Âµstep 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, use memorized positions for autonomous use.
